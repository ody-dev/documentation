We are thrilled to announce the arrival of **ODY v0.2.0**, codenamed **"Circe"**!

Continuing our framework's journey, this release marks a significant milestone. 
Just as Circe possessed transformative powers, this version brings substantial changes aimed squarely at enhancing the 
performance and stability of your ODY applications, particularly under high-load conditions.

ODY "Circe" is packed with architectural refinements, new features, and critical fixes designed to make the framework 
faster, more robust, and easier to work with in demanding environments.

### What's New in Circe (v0.2.0)?

This release focuses heavily on improving how ODY handles concurrency, manages resources, and integrates with modern PHP 
practices, especially within Swoole environments.

#### Key Additions:

* **Async CQRS Implementation:** Laying the foundation for more scalable application architectures, we've introduced an asynchronous Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) implementation (`ody/cqrs:^0.2.0`).
* **RabbitMQ Module:** Easily integrate powerful message queuing capabilities into your applications with the new dedicated AMQP module (`ody/amqp:^0.2.0`).
* **Monolog for Logging:** The logging component has been refactored to utilize the industry-standard Monolog library, offering greater flexibility and features for your logging needs (`ody/logger:^0.2.0`).
* **Updated Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation updates are included to reflect all the new features and changes in v0.2.0.

#### Major Changes & Refinements:

* **Full Swoole Hook Compatibility (`SWOOLE_HOOK_ALL`):** Deep modifications have been made to ensure ODY can safely and effectively leverage `SWOOLE_HOOK_ALL`, unlocking significant potential for I/O-bound performance improvements.
* **Reworked Application Bootstrap:** The application bootstrapping process is now smarter, especially for multi-worker setups (`ody/foundation:^0.2.0`, `ody/server:^0.2.0`). Each worker initializes its own application instance, preventing service registration conflicts and eliminating previous checks, while still allowing bootstrapping outside console environments.
* **Non-Static HTTP Controller Pool:** The `ControllerPool` is no longer static. It's now a standard singleton service managed via dependency injection (`ody/foundation:^0.2.0`), improving testability and adhering to better OOP practices.
* **Non-Static and Streamlined Router:** Following the same principle, the `Router` and `RouteGroup` have been refactored to be non-static (`ody/foundation:^0.2.0`). The router now focuses purely on matching routes to handler identifiers, delegating controller instantiation entirely to the `ControllerDispatcher`/`ControllerResolver`. This results in a cleaner, more decoupled routing system.
* **Improved Pool Item Handling:** To prevent potential deadlocks under load, the initial creation of items in pools (when empty but under capacity) is now synchronous during the borrow process (`ody/connection-pool:^0.2.0`).

#### Important Fixes:

* **Critical Worker Restart Bug:** Resolved a critical issue where `static::$app` could become null after a Swoole worker crash or restart, significantly improving stability.
* **Multi-Worker Race Condition:** Fixed a race condition that could occur in multi-worker Swoole environments where borrowing from an empty pool channel could time out unnecessarily.
* **General Stability:** Addressed several other bugs, improved error handling across the board, and implemented various performance tweaks for a smoother, faster experience.

### Embrace the Transformation

The ODY team believes "Circe" offers a substantially more powerful and stable platform for building high-performance PHP applications. The architectural changes, particularly the move away from static components and the refinements for Swoole, provide a stronger foundation for future development.
