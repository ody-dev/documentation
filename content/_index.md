ODY is a high-performance API framework that leverages Swoole's coroutine capabilities to deliver exceptional speed and 
scalability for modern web applications. Built with modularity at its core, ODY allows developers to implement and 
integrate different modules seamlessly while maintaining clean architecture and code organization.

The framework's asynchronous design eliminates blocking operations, allowing your application to handle thousands of 
concurrent connections with minimal resource consumption. Whether you're building microservices, real-time applications, 
or traditional REST APIs, ODY provides the tools and structure to develop robust, maintainable solutions quickly.

With ODY, you can focus on building your application's business logic while the framework handles the complexities of 
asynchronous programming, request lifecycle management, and module integration.
