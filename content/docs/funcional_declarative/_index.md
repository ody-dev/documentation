## Introduction

ODY provides a set of methods that enable developers to write asynchronous, functional-style code
using coroutines in PHP, making complex operations more readable and efficient. This is ideal to use when trying out new
ideas or when you need a simple lightweight microservice.

This documentation will explore how to use these methods to simplify async programming and enhance developer productivity.
